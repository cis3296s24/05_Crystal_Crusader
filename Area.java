/*
This is just the basic idea, will definitely have to add more methods/variables. Its kind of hard to write
the class without knowing what the other classes will look like, and what our main will look like. Here is
some other ideas for methods that I had.

enterArea() method for when the player initially arrives in the area
searchArea() displays anything in the area (items, enemies, idk)
solveChallenge() I guess this would be the battle so idk if that goes here?
interactWithArea() different commands like "search" (to find item) or "use item" (to use it)
add method that displays something after a certain time after the player entered the area, maybe the enemy appears
